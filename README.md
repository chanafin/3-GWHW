These are some entry-level Python exercises that explore key concepts that can be expanded upon.

Fiber Search - this exercise combines the practices of reading in an external CSV file, looping and using an f-string, all of which are extremely useful for exploring large datasets in a uniform and automated way. 

The first step is to identify, open and read the CSV the user wishes to explore. 

The next step calls  for the creation of a for loop which runs through the entire csv.reader variable (in this case, cereal_reader). 

Variables within the loop are created which represent specific columns and extrable data (index 0 (name of the cereal) and index 7 (fiber count)). 

An if statement is constucted that prints the name of the cereal and its corresponding fiber count if the condition of having a fiber value larger than or equal to five is met.
