These are some entry-level Python exercises that explore key concepts that can be expanded upon.

Fiber Search - this exercise combines the practices of reading in an external CSV file, looping and using an f-string, all of which are extremely useful for exploring large datasets in a uniform and automated way. The first step is to identify, open and read the CSV the user wishes to explore. The next step calls  for the creation of a for loop which runs through the entire csv.reader variable (in this case, cereal_reader). Variables within the loop are created which represent specific columns and extrable data (index 0 (name of the cereal) and index 7 (fiber count)). An if statement is constucted that prints the name of the cereal and its corresponding fiber count if the condition of having a fiber value larger than or equal to five is met.

Number Chain - this represents the introduction of two new, very important Python concepts: a While Loop and User Input. 

The variable number is instatiated as zero and the variable 'playing' is instatiated as equal to 'y'.

While 'playing' == 'y', the instatiate the variable 'user number' which will push an input prompt "How many numbers?"

The user number will be added to the variable number, which starts at zero, but will increase as the loop continues. 

A for loop is created which loops through the range between the variable number and the variable user number and the iterrator is printed to the screen. 

The variable playing will push another input prompt "Are you still playing (y)es or (n)o.
